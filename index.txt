Hi, I’m Dillon.


I’m building something new in the legal AI space. I’m between SF and London right now.


I was previously the CEO & Co-Founder of Slipstream. We raised $1.1M, were part of Neo’s ’23 batch and our investors included some of the earliest checks into FB, Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox and Airtable.


V1: We began as a rentals-as-a-service startup, helping brands like Bird rent out their products (similar to buy-now-pay-later) but realised we had no way to scale into profitability.


V2: In the process, we discovered how broken the credit bureau industry was. We pivoted to build a real-time credit bureau. After finding a novel way to crack the cold-start problem, we discovered that collating accurate real-time data was impossible and returned funds.


I host meet-ups for the Hacker News community in London and fortnightly dinners for founders & operators.
