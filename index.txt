hi, i’m dillon.


i’m building something new in the legal ai space. i’m between sf and london right now.


i was previously the ceo & co-founder of slipstream. we raised $1.1m and were part of neo’s ’23 batch. our investors included some of the earliest cheques into iconic companies like fb, uber, airbnb, dropbox, superhuman and airtable.


v1: we started as a rentals-as-a-service start-up, helping iconic brands like bird rent out their products (similar to buy-now-pay-later) but realised we couldn’t scale into profitability.


v2: in the process, we discovered how broken the credit bureau industry was. we pivoted to build a real-time, accurate, credit bureau. after finding a novel way to crack the cold-start problem we discovered that collating accurate real-time data is impossible and returned funds.


i host meet-ups for the hacker news community in london - most recently at monzo and eqt. our next is at stride vc (date tbc).


i also host weekly dinners for founders & operators.
