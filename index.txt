Hi I’m Dillon.


I’m building something new in the legal AI space. We’re backed by some awesome investors. I’m in SF / Palo Alto right now.


I was previously the CEO & Co-Founder of Slipstream. We raised $1.1m and were part of Neo’s ’23 batch. Our investors included some of the earliest cheques into iconic companies like FB, Uber, AirBnB, Dropbox, Superhuman and Airtable.


v1: We started as a rentals-as-a-service start-up, helping iconic brands like Bird rent out their products (similar to Buy-Now-Pay-Later) but realised we couldn’t scale into profitability.


v2: In the process, we discovered how broken the credit bureau industry was. We pivoted to build a real-time, accurate, credit bureau. After iterating through every approach to cracking the cold-start problem, we returned funds.


I host meet-ups for the Hacker News community in London - most recently at Monzo and EQT. Our next is at Stride VC in March ’24.


I also host weekly dinners for founders & operators.
