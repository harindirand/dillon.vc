Hi, I'm Dillon — a second-time founder building something new in the legal space. I split my time between San Francisco and London, working quietly on a product I believe will change how law firms operate.

My last company, Slipstream, raised $1.1M from top-tier investors — including some of the first backers of Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, and Airtable — and joined Neo's '23 batch. Before that, I worked in JP Morgan's TMT investment banking team.

We began as a rentals-as-a-service platform for brands like Bird, then pivoted to tackle the credit bureau industry with a real-time bureau. We solved the cold-start problem but hit the hard limit of unreliable real-time data — so we made the rare call to return funds.

I'm now applying everything I learned to a bigger, more ambitious problem.
